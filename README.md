"How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?" 
I interpret the needs by putting myself into the position of the user and figuring out what functionality I would need or want to see in the program for the maximum effectiveness of the program as well as ease of use. You can also take time to work with your teammates to brainstorm what these might look like and have a good time figuring out what works best. "User stories" are a method of putting yourself into the shoes of the end user to create scenarios a user might run into when using the program. These help programmers come up with good ideas for things to implement into the product.
